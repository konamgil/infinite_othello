# Advanced Replay Analysis Feature

This document provides an overview of the Advanced Replay Analysis feature.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Problem Solved

The previous analysis panel completely covered the game board on mobile devices, making it impossible to see moves while reading the analysis. This feature introduces a new, sophisticated UX that solves this problem and provides a scalable platform for future analysis capabilities.

## Solution

The new system introduces a sliding bottom panel that ensures the board is always visible on mobile devices. It also includes a rich set of features for in-depth game analysis.
